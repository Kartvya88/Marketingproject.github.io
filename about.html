        <br>The interconnected global challenges of fast-paced car passions  have made this a  focus for our business and we <br>are taking a hard look at our business  and how we can drive change.The company also enjoyed great success in early <br> Grand Prix motor racing: in 1929 a privately entered Bugatti won the first ever Monaco Grand Prix.<br> Racing success culminated with driver Jean-Pierre Wimille winning the 24 hours of Le Mans twice (in 1937 with Robert Benoist and 1939 with Pierre Veyron).

    <h3><u>FOUNDER OF BUGATTI</u> </h3>
    <!-- content for the about us page  -->

    <p >Founder Ettore Bugatti was born in Milan, Italy, and the automobile company that bears his name was<br> founded in 1909 in Molsheim located in the Alsace region which was part of the German Empire from 1871 to 1919.<br> The company was known both for the level of detail of its engineering in its automobiles, and for the artistic manner <br>in which the designs were executed, given the artistic nature of Ettore's family (his father, Carlo Bugatti (1856–1940),<br> was an important Art Nouveau furniture and jewelry designer).The death of Ettore Bugatti in 1947 proved to be the end for the marque,<br> and the death of his son Jean Bugatti in 1939 ensured there was not a successor to lead the factory. No more than about 8,000 cars were made.<br> The company struggled financially, and released one last model in the 1950s, before eventually being purchased for its airplane parts business in 1963.</p>
